# API Configuration
# Backend API URL - Update this based on your environment

# For local development (backend running on localhost)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

# For production (deployed backend)
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com/api

# IMPORTANT: The URL must end with /api because all backend routes are under /api prefix
# Example: https://liftuplabs-backend.onrender.com/api

# Note: Vite requires environment variables to be prefixed with VITE_
# to be exposed to the client-side code
